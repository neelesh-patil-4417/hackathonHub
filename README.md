# hackathonHub
Imagine you are working for an Edtech company and you are asked to create a simple Hackathon hosting application. The hackathon can be posted by anyone and they will be authorized before they are allowed to post hackathons. Users should be able to come and submit some code or files as hackathon submissions.
